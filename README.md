# UFOS
Project summary
The purpose of the project is to present in website to the readers of the UFO findings and tables. The readers can use the website to get an idea of UFO sightings with description article and tables. And if the readers want to get an idea of specific factors for UFO sightings, they can use the filter in the page to get a better idea of specific facts.
We use javascript language to write our table filter and load our data. We use html to write our website. We use Visual Studio Code tool to write our code for java app and html language. Also we use CSS to get the style of our page.
For the future development, we can add duration also as a factor of filter. We can collect and update table with data that has date other than 2010. And we can add more images if possible.
